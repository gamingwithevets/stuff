This is where I put all my super epic and totally very random stuff. Currently, I have:

**Folders:**
- [`sneky_tut`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/sneky_tut) - Contains tutorials for Sneky. ~~Will delete when the Sneky website goes public.~~ Sneky tutorials are no longer made or added here, so this is now just kept here for archival.

**Files:**
- [`2slow.swf`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/2slow.swf) - YouTuber [danooct1](https://www.youtube.com/@danooct1) once hosted a mirror of the infamous You Are An Idiot trojan. Then, it was changed to play this Flash file, with the page title *Nice try, but you're too slow!*. After that it changed to a web page that linked to [danooct1's video of the YAAI trojan](https://youtu.be/LSgk7ctw1HY), then shut down along with the entire `danooct1.com` website.
- [`GWE.png`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/GWE.png) - It's my avatar! Yay! Don't you steal it though.
- [`pinball.zip`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/pinball.zip) - The x86 version of **3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet**. No bugs. **NOTE:** EXE file taken from [here](https://github.com/k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball).
- [`pinball_amd64.zip`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/pinball_amd64.zip) - The AMD64 version of **3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet**, freshly extracted from the **Windows XP Professional x64 Edition** CD. Contains a bug where the lights are misaligned.
- [`test.md`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/test.html) - An MD file I wrote to test Markdown's capabilities. ;)
- [`vip.user.js`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/vip.user.js) - The [Casio ClassPad](https://classpad.net) "Enhancer". Install it with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). Enables all VIP features in ClassPad Math. Useful if you need Casio emulators that are not available for download on Casio's [Software License](https://edu.casio.com/softwarelicense) page.
