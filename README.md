This is where I put all my super epic and totally very random stuff. Currently, I have:

**Folders:**
- [`sneky_tut`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/sneky_tut) - Contains tutorials for Sneky. Will delete when the Sneky website goes public.

**Files:**
- [`GWE.png`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/GWE.png) - It's my avatar! Yay! Don't you steal it though.
- [`pinball_amd64.zip`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/pinball_amd64.zip) - The AMD64 version of **3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet**, freshly extracted from the **Windows XP Professional x64 Edition** CD. Contains a bug where the lights are misaligned.
- [`pinball.zip`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/pinball.zip) - The x86 version of **3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet**. No bugs.
- [`test.md`](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/stuff/test.html) - An MD file I wrote to test Markdown's capabilities. ;)
